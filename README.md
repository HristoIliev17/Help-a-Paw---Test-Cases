# Help-a-Paw---Test-Cases
Welcome to the Help a Paw Test Case Repository!

This repository contains a subset (8 out of 72) of test cases designed to ensure the functionality, security, and user experience of the Help a Paw mobile application on both Android and Apple devices. These test cases are intended for use with the Qase test management platform. They cover areas such as functional tests (registration, login, reporting), UI/UX tests (navigation, layout), compatibility tests (across different OS versions and devices), security tests (vulnerability assessment) and performance tests (speed, responsiveness).

# The selected test cases are located in "Issues"
Some of the test cases are containing defects(bugs) and are labeled as "bug", also there are "actual results" for the selected test cases so that the deviation from the "expected results" can be traced.
